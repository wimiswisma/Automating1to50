# Automating1to50
This Repository belongs to play 1 to 50 games 
familiar with the game 1to50. It's a simple yet challenging game where the player needs to touch each number from 1 to 50 in ascending order within the shortest time possible. The grid starts with 5 by 5, displaying the first 25 numbers, and as the player touches each number, the remaining ones appear.

To find elements/selectors from the web user interface in Katalon Studio (or any other automation tool), you typically use various methods such as:

Inspect Element: Right-click on the web page element you want to interact with and select "Inspect" (or similar option depending on your browser). This will open the browser's developer tools, where you can view the HTML structure of the web page and identify the element's attributes like id, class, name, etc.

XPath: XPath is a powerful language for selecting nodes in an XML document (including HTML). You can use XPath expressions to locate elements based on their attributes, position in the DOM tree, etc.

CSS Selector: CSS selectors are patterns used to select elements in an HTML document. They are widely used in web development and can also be used to locate elements in automation testing.

Record and Playback: Many automation tools, including Katalon Studio, offer a record and playback feature. You can start recording, perform actions on the web page (e.g., click buttons, enter text), and the tool will generate test steps based on your actions.

Manual Inspection: Sometimes, elements may not have unique attributes or may be dynamically generated. In such cases, manual inspection of the HTML structure and experimentation with different locators may be necessary to find the most reliable selector.

Once you've identified the elements/selectors you need to interact with (e.g., numbers in the 1to50 game grid), you can use Katalon Studio's built-in keywords and methods to interact with those elements during test execution. These interactions may include clicking, hovering, entering text, verifying text, etc.
